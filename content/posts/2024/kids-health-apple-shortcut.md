As a father of three, my mind is constanaly loaded with a lot of things. In addition, I'm being constatntly distructed by their requests. So any way to offload important things from my brain to some external storage helps a lot.

One of the common themes is tracking when they get sick, and medications or procedures that we need to do for them. In a rush of the days, often times we can't even remember what happened yesterday, or the week before.

I'd like to share a simple, yet quite useful Apple Shortcut workflow, that I've built for myself to capture this.
