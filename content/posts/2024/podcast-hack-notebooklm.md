### A way to "listen" to podcasts with NotebookLM

I've been a podcast junkie for years, my Podcasts library includes over 70 shows since getting hooked on podcasts back in 2016. Edutainment has always been my sweet spot – stories that inform and entertain me at the same time. My journey began with [99 percent invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org), which was introduced to me by a fellow product manager at work. I was captivated by the storytelling, information, and production quality. At this point the topics of the shows I'm listening to span from product management, business, and AI to psychology, world news, and arts. In future, I'll add a section to this site with the podcasts I love and recommend.

Fast-forward to today, and while I still enjoy listening to podcasts, I usually do this while doing something else. I've come to realise that my brain is not as effective at retaining information as I thought. Trying to recall specific insights from previous episodes often leaves me feeling like a blank slate. As a Kindle reader, I rely heavily on highlighting passages of interest to review later. However, when it comes to podcasts, the lack of seamless note-taking capabilities has been a major frustration.

That's why I've embarked on a quest to find an alternative solution that combines Apple Podcasts with Google's NotebookLM. While there are a few apps that allow “highlighting” sections of the podcast while listening to it for further review, I don’t want to switch from native Podcasts app. The breakthrough came when I discovered Apple's automated transcript feature in their Podcasts app – introduced a couple of years ago. Now, it's possible to save transcripts into text files with ease.

## Unlocking Insights

### Step 1: Access the Transcript

Open the podcast episode you want to summarise and access the transcript.

### Step 2: Select All Text

Select all the transcript text by highlighting it with a cursor. Right-click and choose **Services > Show in Finder**. _If you try to copy the selected text with CMD+C, it won't work as intended – only a short snippet will be pasted_.

**Voilà!** A new Finder window opens, revealing a text file named 'text.txt' containing the full transcript.

### Step 3: Upload and Explore

Upload this file into NotebookLM and start exploring. NotebookLM instantly generates a summary of the episode based on the transcript you've uploaded. It also suggests contextual follow up questions.

Then you can simply ask questions via a chat interface similar to ChatGPT or Claude, and save the responses as notes for future reference.

By leveraging Apple Podcasts and Google's NotebookLM, I've discovered a game-changing workflow that enables me to effortlessly summarise, review, and retain valuable insights from my favourite podcasts. No more missed opportunities to uncover and record new ideas – only clarity and focus. Obviously, it’s not the only way to do this, but it’s fast and free, at least for now.

## Bonus

I’ve asked Claude to roast me based on my podcast subscriptions in the style of Ricky Gervais 🙃

_Oh, bloody hell, look at this list! It's like a cry for help, innit? You've got more podcasts here than I've had hot dinners. Let's dive into this cesspool of auditory masochism, shall we?_

_First off, "Office Ladies." Really? You're so desperate to relive the glory days of a show that ended years ago that you need Pam and Angela to hold your hand through each episode? What's next, a podcast where Jim reads you bedtime stories?_

_And what's this? "Huberman Lab"? Oh, aren't we feeling intellectual today! Listening to a neuroscientist talk about the brain while you're sprawled on the couch, shoveling crisps into your gob. Yeah, that'll make you smarter, mate._

_"How I Built This with Guy Raz." Brilliant. Because what the world needs is another wanker thinking they're the next Steve Jobs after listening to some Silicon Valley twat brag about their startup for an hour._

_"Freakonomics Radio"? Let me guess, you drop this one into conversation at parties to seem clever. "Well, actually, according to Freakonomics..." Shut up, no one cares!_

_Oh, and "The Tim Ferriss Show." Fantastic. Nothing says "I'm a productive member of society" like listening to a self-help guru while you're still in your pants at 2 in the afternoon._

_"Lenny's Podcast: Product | Growth | Career." Mate, the only product you need to worry about is shampoo, the only growth you're experiencing is your waistline, and your career is a joke._

_"The Daily"? Why bother with actual newspapers when you can have some yanks summarize the world's problems for you in 20 minutes? That's depth, that is._

_And what's this? "Everything is Alive"? Are you that lonely that you need to pretend inanimate objects can talk to you? Maybe try going outside and talking to real people for a change. Oh wait, you can't – you're too busy listening to all these bloody podcasts!_

_Look, I get it. Life's hard, and sometimes you need to escape. But this list? It's not an escape; it's a cry for help. You're not expanding your mind; you're filling it with more useless trivia than a pub quiz champion with a drinking problem._

_Do yourself a favor: turn off the podcasts, step away from your phone, and try living in the real world for a change. Who knows? You might actually learn something useful – like how to have a personality that doesn't revolve around what some bloke said on a podcast._

_But hey, what do I know? I'm just a comedian. At least I'm not the one with "Explaining Ukraine" in my subscriptions. Because nothing says "I'm a geopolitical expert" like getting your information from a podcast, right? Christ almighty, I need a drink after this. And so do you, by the looks of it._
