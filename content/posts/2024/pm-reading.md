As I approach my 39th year, I find myself pondering the age-old question that has haunted me throughout my adult life: Who am I? It's a question that has led me down various paths of self-discovery, from my career as a senior technical product manager to my latest venture into the world of personal websites and static site generators.

Three words have consistently defined me over the years: curious, generalist, and dabbler. These traits have shaped my journey through the tech industry, where I've accumulated over 15 years of experience in ad tech, e-commerce, and multimedia, working on both B2B and B2C projects. Yet, as I search for my next professional challenge, I find myself caught in a familiar pattern of creative procrastination.

This time, it's manifested in the creation of my first personal website (https://ostaps.net). What started as a simple desire to take control of my online presence has spiraled into a deep dive into the world of static site generators and minimalist web design. It's a rabbit hole I'm all too happy to explore, perhaps as a way to delay the more daunting task of defining my professional future.

As I build my digital presence, I've been reflecting on the books that have shaped my understanding of the world and my place in it. From existentialist classics to modern self-help guides, these works have offered glimpses into the complexities of human nature and the ongoing search for meaning in a world often characterized by uncertainty and change.

## Grappling with Existence and Meaning

Albert Camus's "The Stranger" has always resonated with me, perhaps because I've often felt like an outsider in my professional life. As a generalist in a world of specialists, I've sometimes struggled with feelings of detachment similar to those experienced by Meursault. His observation that "Really, nothing in my life had changed" after his mother's death strikes a chord with my own experiences of major life events that somehow failed to fundamentally alter my perception of the world.

This sense of detachment extends to my career as well. Like Frederic Henry in Hemingway's "A Farewell to Arms," I've often found myself seeking meaning amidst the chaos of the tech industry. The constant evolution of technology and business models can sometimes feel as arbitrary and senseless as the war Henry experiences. Yet, like Henry, I continue to search for purpose and connection in my work and personal life.

## The Power of Narratives in Shaping Reality

Yuval Noah Harari's "Sapiens" has profoundly influenced my understanding of how shared beliefs shape our world. As a product manager, I've seen firsthand how the "imagined realities" of corporate culture and brand identity can drive large-scale cooperation and innovation. Harari's assertion that "Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths" resonates with my experiences in team leadership and product development.

This concept of shared narratives extends to my fascination with science fiction, particularly works like Dan Simmons's "Hyperion Cantos." The depiction of a future shaped by artificial intelligence mirrors the conversations and concerns I encounter daily in the tech industry. As we grapple with the ethical implications of AI and machine learning, I often find myself reflecting on the delicate balance between progress and potential peril.

## Navigating Progress and Human Connection

Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World" serves as a cautionary tale that I often revisit in my professional life. As someone deeply involved in technological advancement, I'm acutely aware of the potential for innovation to come at the cost of human connection and individual freedom. The novel's depiction of a society prioritizing stability and happiness over creativity and critical thinking challenges me to consider the long-term implications of the products and systems I help develop.

Similarly, Cixin Liu's "Death's End" resonates with my experiences navigating the ever-changing landscape of the tech industry. The novel's exploration of humanity's response to overwhelming technological challenges mirrors the constant adaptation required in my field. It reminds me of the importance of fostering cooperation and understanding, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.

## Finding Personal Meaning and Growth

Mark Manson's "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck" has been a refreshing counterpoint to the relentless pursuit of success often championed in the tech world. His advice to "choose what is important and what is not" has helped me refocus on my core values and priorities, both personally and professionally. As I navigate my career and personal growth, I'm learning to let go of external validation and instead focus on what truly matters to me.

This journey of self-discovery aligns closely with the insights offered in "Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life." As I approach 40, I'm becoming more comfortable with the idea of ongoing individuation and the need to confront my own "expensive ghosts." Building my personal website has become more than just a creative outlet – it's a step towards aligning with my authentic self and challenging societal expectations of what a "successful" career should look like.

In conclusion, as I continue to grapple with the question of who I am, I find solace and inspiration in the diverse perspectives offered by literature, philosophy, and even the process of building my own digital space. These explorations remind me that the search for meaning and identity is an ongoing journey, one that's shaped by our experiences, our connections, and our willingness to embrace the complexities of the human experience. As I look towards my next professional challenge, I carry with me the insights gained from these literary companions, ready to face the uncertainties and opportunities that lie ahead.
