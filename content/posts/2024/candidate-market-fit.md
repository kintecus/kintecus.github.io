As a seasoned Product leader with 15+ years in ad tech, e-commerce, and multimedia, I'm energized to jump back into the market after a refreshing sabbatical! I've used this time to reflect on my career goals and aspirations, and I'm excited about the possibilities ahead. 

**My focus?** Securing a *Senior or Principal Product Manager role as an individual contributor*, where I can leverage my expertise to drive tangible impact on data-driven products while maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

From leading platform development at Voicemod, a dynamic startup with over 5 million users, to managing complex technical projects at the enterprise level within Amazon Advertising, my career has been defined by a passion for tackling complex challenges and transforming innovative ideas into successful products. I thrive in collaborative, mission-driven environments that value individual contribution and foster a culture of continuous learning.

My recent experience has solidified my passion for data visualization, reporting, and building elegant solutions that empower users with actionable insights. That's why I'm particularly drawn to companies specializing in data analytics or related fields where my skills and experience in this area can be instrumental in shaping the future of data-driven products.

While I've enjoyed leadership roles in the past, I've realized that my true strength and passion lie in being a hands-on contributor. I'm at a point in my life, both personally and professionally, where I'm eager to focus my energy on making a direct impact on the product development lifecycle, working alongside talented teams to solve challenging problems, and building exceptional user experiences.

My ideal company would be a growing organization—perhaps a company in a later-stage startup phase—where I can contribute significantly to the company's trajectory. I'm drawn to companies that prioritize building great products and foster a positive and supportive work environment where collaboration and individual growth are paramount.

I believe my technical expertise, coupled with my strategic mindset and passion for data-driven solutions, makes me a valuable asset to any product team. I'm eager to connect with companies and individuals who share my values and are excited about the power of data to transform businesses and improve lives.
Let's connect and explore how I can contribute to your company's success!
