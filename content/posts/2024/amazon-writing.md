In my [previous post](../amazon-working-backwards), I discussed Amazon's "Working Backwards" methodology, a customer-centric approach that permeates everything Amazon does. But there's another key element of the Amazon Way that's essential for the Working Backwards methodology to succeed: Amazon Writing. This isn't about literary flair, but rather a relentless focus on clear, concise, and persuasive writing that prioritizes the reader above all else.
You see, at Amazon, writing is more than just a means of communication; it's a powerful tool for driving decision-making and achieving alignment. Think of it as the backbone of the Working Backwards process. A poorly written document can derail even the most innovative idea, while a well-crafted one can rally support and propel a product from concept to launch.

### So, what exactly makes Amazon Writing so unique?

1. Obsession with Clarity and Concision: Amazonians are masters of brevity, eschewing jargon and unnecessary flourishes in favor of direct, accessible language. The goal is to communicate ideas effectively, regardless of the reader's technical expertise.

2. Narrative-Driven Structure: Instead of dry, data-heavy reports, Amazon favors a narrative-driven approach. This means crafting a compelling story that engages the reader, making complex information easier to digest and remember. Imagine presenting a new product idea as a captivating news article, highlighting the customer problem, proposed solution, and potential impact. That's the power of narrative writing in action.

3. Rigorous Review Process: Amazon has a dedicated team of "writing ninjas" who review documents and provide feedback. These individuals are masters of Amazon Writing principles and help ensure that all written communication adheres to the company's high standards.

### But perhaps the most impactful element of Amazon Writing is the concept of the "6-pager."

This document format, as the name suggests, is limited to six pages and serves as the cornerstone for decision-making at Amazon. Imagine distilling a complex business proposal, complete with market analysis, product roadmap, and financial projections, into a concise and persuasive six-page document. This rigorous process forces teams to prioritize information, think critically about their ideas, and anticipate potential questions.

The 6-pager typically includes sections like:

- Press Release (PR): Written as a compelling news article, highlighting the key value proposition of the product or initiative.
- Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs): Addressing both internal and external stakeholders, covering topics like market opportunity, competitive landscape, and potential challenges.
The 6-pager is then presented and collectively read during a dedicated meeting, allowing for focused discussion and feedback. This ensures everyone is literally on the same page and fosters a culture of shared understanding and thoughtful decision-making.

A great exampel example - Amazon hates *weasel words*:

- *About/Around:* These words introduce vagueness. Instead of "We have around 500 users," Amazon writing would favor precision: "We have 487 users."
- *Believe/Think:* These words express opinions rather than facts. Amazon encourages data-driven decision-making, so instead of "We believe customers want this feature," a better approach would be "Customer feedback suggests strong demand for this feature."
- *May/Maybe/Might:* These words express uncertainty and can create ambiguity about decisions and next steps. Amazon's writing prioritizes clarity, so instead of "We might launch next month," a more definitive statement like "Our target launch date is June 15th, pending final approvals" would be preferred.
- *Soon:* This word lacks a specific timeframe. Amazon values clear communication, so instead of "We'll launch soon," a more concrete timeline such as "We'll launch in Q3" would be more effective.
- *Just:* This word often minimizes the importance of a statement. Amazon encourages writers to be direct and impactful, so instead of "We just need a few more weeks," a more straightforward statement like "We need three more weeks" would be more appropriate.
- *Generally:* This word implies exceptions and lacks specificity. Amazon encourages data-driven arguments, so instead of "Customers generally like this feature," a more precise and impactful statement might be "80% of surveyed customers rated this feature positively."
- *Hope:* Similar to "believe" or "think," this word expresses a desire rather than a plan. Amazon's culture emphasizes action and accountability. Instead of "We hope to achieve these goals," a better approach would be "Our plan is to achieve these goals through the following initiatives."

By avoiding these weasel words, Amazon ensures that internal documents are clear, concise, and actionable. This is essential for the "Working Backwards" methodology, as it relies on shared understanding and alignment across teams.

Amazon Writing, with its emphasis on clarity, persuasion, and meticulous review, is the unsung hero of Amazon's success. It's a powerful tool that enables Amazonians to effectively communicate ideas, build consensus, and ultimately, create products and services that customers love.
