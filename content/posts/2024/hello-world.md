It took me only gazillion years to finally start building myself a personal site with a blog. I’ve had this idea for years, but somehow never got to kicking it off. Probably because of two things: 1) not having a good answer to the question of questions - **why?**, 2) thinking about **who** will read it, and do I even have **what** to share with them.

Finally in the recent days, I’ve just set off and started playing with it. Bought my first domain, spent many evenings researching a good way to do this, looking at other people’s personal sites for inspiration. And I must say I enjoy diving into this rabbit hole so much - I haven’t been so excited about dabbling with something for a while.

What’s also different this time, is the fact that now I have some answers (not ideal, but good enough) to the existential questions above.

I'll cover ****why**** in this post:

1. I want to have a personal space online, that is protected from whims of platforms
2. I want to use it as a tool to craft the narrative about myself
3. I enjoy the technical side of it
4. It can be a forcing function to get me to write more regularly

Welcome to *Who Am I?*
